## Setup

This is a Python 3 project.  The following instructions assume you have Python

[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) installed.

    mkvirtualenv -p python3 pandas_intro
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    jupyter notebook


Once the notebook server is running, navigate to
[http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) and double
